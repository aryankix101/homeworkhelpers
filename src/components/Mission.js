                                    <p>The purpose of Homework Helpers is to provide a unique cross-age peer-tutoring experience for Title 1 elementary schools across Fairfax County. Our program is focused on recruiting middle school student volunteers to tutor younger elementary students in need of educational support. As a result of a minimal age gap, we believe the tutee and tutor will form a sibling-like bond throughout the school year. This age proximity also provides tutees with an effective role-model to learn from.
This educational experience can yield a myriad of beneficial effects for both students, enabling them to reach their full academic potentials.
<br/>
Our program is built on the foundation of the 5 'C's:
<br/>
-<strong>Competence</strong>
<br/>
-<strong>Confidence</strong>
<br/>
-<strong>Connection</strong>
<br/>
-<strong>Character</strong>
<br/>
-<strong>Caring</strong></p>
